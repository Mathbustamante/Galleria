###### Description:

My website will simulate a shopping website. Users of the website will be able to post, delete, edit, new products.
The content of my page will have a list of products on the first page, a more detailed page when clicking on the item. Some description of the product, price, image, etc.
I am thinking of using Nodejs as my API by using a database. So the API will have the product detail when the user posts a new product.

To do the iteraction between React and NodeJs, I got some help from this tutorial: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_klist=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE)
